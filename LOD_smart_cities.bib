	abstract = {The requirements specified by the {REDm-MED} Project for data management plans will be assembled both from a ?bottom-up? elicitation process involving researchers and academics, and ?top-down? from funder requirements, institutional policy and known good practice. Data management lifecycle models provide a structure for considering the many operations that will need to be performed on a data record throughout its life; as such they can also act as a useful touchstone for ensuring the requirements specification has sufficient coverage of key data management operations.},
