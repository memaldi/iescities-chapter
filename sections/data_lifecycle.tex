\section{Data Life Cycle}

Throughout the literature, a variety of different definitions of data life cycle models can be found. Although they have been developed for different actuation domains, we describe here some of them which we think that can be applied for generic data, independently of its original domain.

The first model to be analysed is the model proposed by Data Documentation Initiative (DDI). The DDI introduced a Combined Life Cycle Model for data managing \cite{data_documentation_initiative_overview_2008}. As Figure shows, this model has eight elements or steps which can be summarized as follows, according to \cite{ball_review_2012}:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Study Concept:}
