\title{Linked Open Data as the fuel for Smarter Cities}

\begin{document}
    \maketitle

    \abstract{In the last decade big efforts have been carried out in order to move towards the Smart City concept, both from the academic and industrial points of view. Cities have been sensorized, protocols are constantly refined to deal with the possibilities that new hardware offers, communication networks are offered in all flavours... and meanwhile researchers and data stakeholders try to figure out how to cope with the huge amount of generated data.

Open Data has arisen in the last years as a way to share data to be consumed freely without restrictions from copyright, patents or other mechanisms of control. Nowadays Open Data is an achievable concept thanks to the World Wide Web, and has been re-defined for its application in different domains.

Regarding public administrations, the concept of Open Government has found an ally in Open Data concepts, defending citizens' right to access data, documentation and proceedings of the governments. The data generated by a city council is highly difficult to manage in an efficient way, due to the facts described earlier, usually resulting in large amounts of data not being analysed and affecting negatively the end-users of the information.

We propose Linked Open Data, a set of best practices to publish data on the Web proposed by W3C, as a way of publishing data among governments, easing their consumption by anybody, both companies and third parties interested in the exploitation of the data, and citizens as end users receiving relevant curated information and reports about their city.

We also advocate the role of citizens as linked open data providers. User-friendly Linked Data apps should enable citizens to easily contribute with new trustable data that can be linked to already existing published (more static generally) Linked Data provided by councils. In addition, people-centric mobile sensing, enabled by ubiquitously wearing smartphones, should progress into continous people-centric enriched Linked Data. Linked Open Data also encourages the linkage to other resources described formally through structured vocabularies, allowing the discovery of related information and the possibility to make inferences, resulting in higher quality data.

In summary, Linked Open Data uses the previous Openness concepts to evolve from an infrastructure thought for humans, to an architecture for the automatic consumption of big amounts of data, providing relevant and high quality data to end users with low maintenance costs. Smart data can now be achievable in smart cities.}
